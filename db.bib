  abstract  = {A recurrent loop consisting of a single Hodgkin-Huxley neuron influenced by a chemical excitatory delayed synaptic feedback is considered. We show that the behavior of the system depends on the duration of the activity of the synapse, which is determined by the activation and deactivation time constants of the synapse. For the fast synapses, those for which the effect of the synaptic activity is small compared to the period of firing, depending on the delay time, spiking with single and multiple interspike intervals is possible and the average firing rate can be smaller or larger than that of the open loop neuron. For slow synapses for which the synaptic time constants are of order of the period of the firing, the self-excitation increases the firing rate for all values of the delay time. We also show that for a chain consisting of few similar oscillators, if the synapses are chosen from different time constants, the system will follow the dynamics imposed by the fastest element, which is the oscillator that receives excitations via a slow synapse. The generalization of the results to other types of relaxation oscillators is discussed and the results are compared to those of the loops with inhibitory synapses as well as with gap junctions.},

  abstract  = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modifies synaptic strengths based on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. The temporal order of spikes turned out to be crucial. We here take into account how propagation delays, composed of dendritic and axonal delay times, may affect the temporal order of spikes. In a minimal setting, characterized by neglecting dendritic and axonal propagation delays, STDP eliminates bidirectional connections between two coupled neurons and turns them into unidirectional connections. In this paper, however, we show that depending on the dendritic and axonal propagation delays, the temporal order of spikes at the synapses can be different from those in the cell bodies and, consequently, qualitatively different connectivity patterns emerge. In particular, we show that for a system of two coupled oscillatory neurons, bidirectional synapses can be preserved and potentiated. Intriguingly, this finding also translates to large networks of type-II phase oscillators and, hence, crucially impacts on the overall hierarchical connectivity patterns of oscillatory neuronal networks.},

  abstract  = {Time delay is a general feature of all interactions. Although the effects of delayed interaction are often neglected when the intrinsic dynamics is much slower than the coupling delay, they can be crucial otherwise. We show that delayed coupled neuronal networks support transitions between synchronous and asynchronous states when the level of input to the network changes. The level of input determines the oscillation period of neurons and hence whether time-delayed connections are synchronizing or desynchronizing. We find that synchronizing connections lead to synchronous dynamics, whereas desynchronizing connections lead to out-of-phase oscillations in network motifs and to frustrated states with asynchronous dynamics in large networks. Since the impact of a neuronal network to downstream neurons increases when spikes are synchronous, networks with delayed connections can serve as gatekeeper layers mediating the firing transfer to other regions. This mechanism can regulate the opening and closing of communicating channels between cortical layers on demand.},

The emergent effective flow of directed connections introduces the high-frequency neurons as the more influential elements in the network and facilitates synchronization by decreasing the synaptic cost for onset of synchronization.},

  abstract  = {In principle, two directly coupled limit cycle oscillators can overcome mismatch in intrinsic rates and match their frequencies, but zero phase lag synchronization is just achievable in the limit of zero mismatch, i.e., with identical oscillators. Delay in communication, on the other hand, can exert phase shift in the activity of the coupled oscillators. In this study, we address the question of how phase locked, and in particular zero phase lag synchronization, can be achieved for a heterogeneous system of two delayed coupled neurons. We have analytically studied the possibility of inphase synchronization and near inphase synchronization when the neurons are not identical or the connections are not exactly symmetric. We have shown that while any single source of inhomogeneity can violate isochronous synchrony, multiple sources of inhomogeneity can compensate for each other and maintain synchrony. Numeric studies on biologically plausible models also support the analytic results.},

  abstract  = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) adjusts synaptic strengths according to the precise timing of pre- and postsynaptic spike pairs. Theoretical and computational studies have revealed that STDP may contribute to the emergence of a variety of structural and dynamical states in plastic neuronal populations. In this manuscript, we show that by incorporating dendritic and axonal propagation delays in recurrent networks of oscillatory neurons, the asymptotic connectivity displays multistability, where different structures emerge depending on the initial distribution of the synaptic strengths. In particular, we show that the standard deviation of the initial distribution of synaptic weights, besides its mean, determines the main properties of the emergent structural connectivity such as the mean final synaptic weight, the number of two-neuron loops and the symmetry of the final structure. We also show that the firing rates of the neurons affect the evolution of the network, and a more symmetric configuration of the synapses emerges at higher firing rates. We justify the network results based on a two-neuron framework and show how the results translate to large recurrent networks.},

  abstract  = {Neuronal oscillations are suggested to play an important role in auditory working memory (WM), but their contribution to content-specific representations has remained unclear. Here, we measure magnetoencephalography during a retro-cueing task with parametric ripple-sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to speech but resist non-auditory memory strategies. Using machine learning analyses, with rigorous between-subject cross-validation and non-parametric permutation testing, we show that memorized sound content is strongly represented in phase-synchronization patterns between subregions of auditory and frontoparietal cortices. These phase-synchronization patterns predict the memorized sound content steadily across the studied maintenance period. In addition to connectivity-based representations, there are indices of more local, “activity silent” representations in auditory cortices, where the decoding accuracy of WM content significantly increases after task-irrelevant “impulse stimuli.” Our results demonstrate that synchronization patterns across auditory sensory and association areas orchestrate neuronal coding of auditory WM content. This connectivity-based coding scheme could also extend beyond the auditory domain.},
